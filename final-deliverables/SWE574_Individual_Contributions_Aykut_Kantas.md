## Requirements fulfilled

### F-1.1 New members shall register with a unique username and password.

**Description:**
The registration feature requires new members to create a unique username and password. This ensures secure, individualized access and maintains data integrity within our system.

**Issue:**
[Register page design #145](https://github.com/SWE574-Fall2023-Group1/SWE574-Fall2023-G1/issues/145)

**Pull request:**
[feature/145-register-page-design](https://github.com/SWE574-Fall2023-Group1/SWE574-Fall2023-G1/pull/146)

#### Explanation of the code

The code is a segment from a React component for a registration page in our web application. It features a user interface where individuals can sign up by entering their username, email, and password. The layout is built using Flexbox for centering and arranging elements, and inline CSS styles are applied for consistent design. The form includes TextField components for input fields, each with event handlers to update state and handle key presses. A Button component is used for submitting the registration form, with an onClick event linked to the form submission logic. Additional elements like spacing divs and a ToastContainer for notifications are included. The design focuses on a clean, user-friendly experience with direct feedback and interaction.

### F-1.2 Members shall log in with their username and password.

**Description:**
Members must use a unique combination of a username and a password to log in. The username serves as a personal identifier, distinct for each member, while the password provides a secure key, known only to the member and the system.

**Issue:**
[Design Login Page #147](https://github.com/SWE574-Fall2023-Group1/SWE574-Fall2023-G1/issues/147)

**Pull request:**
[feature/147-design-login-page](https://github.com/SWE574-Fall2023-Group1/SWE574-Fall2023-G1/pull/148)

#### Explanation of the code

The code represents login page in our React web application. It features a centralized layout with Flexbox styling and a responsive design. Key elements include an image header, username and password input fields (using TextField components), and a visually appealing login button with an onClick event handler. The page also provides navigation options for new users to register and for existing users to recover forgotten passwords. The design is consistent and user-friendly, focusing on ease of use and clear navigation. A ToastContainer is included for displaying notifications, enhancing user interaction and feedback.

### F-2.15 The system shall allow users to see other's memories on feed page.

**Description:**
This requirement outlines that the system will feature a feed page where users can view memories shared by others. The feed will display a collection of posts representing memories. Each user will have the ability to access this feed and browse through these shared memories, fostering a sense of community and connection among the user base. The system's design will ensure that this feed is easily navigable and visually engaging, enhancing the user experience.

**Issue:**
[Redesign homepage #150](https://github.com/SWE574-Fall2023-Group1/SWE574-Fall2023-G1/issues/147)

**Pull request:**
[Feature/150 design homepage](https://github.com/SWE574-Fall2023-Group1/SWE574-Fall2023-G1/pull/205)

#### Explanation of the code

The React component which we used in home page of our web application displays a list of stories with pagination. When loading, it shows a "Loading..." message. Once loaded, it lists stories, each with an author photo, username, and creation date. Story titles are clickable, leading to more details. Date and location are also shown, enhanced with icons. The pagination section at the bottom allows users to navigate between pages. CSS styling is applied for a clean and interactive user interface, with hover effects and clickable elements for a better user experience.

### F-3.3 The system shall display activities of the followed users.

**Description:**
The system will have a feature to showcase the activities of users that an individual follows. This functionality will allow users to stay updated with the actions (such as follow, unfollow, comment, create new story, like, unlike).

**Issue:**

[Add commented activity on activity stream #133](https://github.com/SWE574-Fall2023-Group1/SWE574-Fall2023-G1-mobile/pull/133)

#### Explanation of the code

The code is a part of our Flutter mobile application, specifically for the "Activity Stream" feature. It displays a stream of user activities like story likes, follows, comments, etc., in a list format. State Management uses the Bloc pattern for managing the application's state. Different states like loading, success, failure, and offline are handled to update the UI accordingly. Activity Stream Route is defined as a StatefulWidget, which means it has a mutable state. It's responsible for displaying the activity stream. The UI is built dynamically based on the current state. It includes a loading indicator, a list of activities, error messages, and offline indicators. Each activity is represented with an icon and a description, both determined by the type of activity (like liking a story, following a user, etc.). The app allows users to interact with the activity stream, like navigating to a user's profile when an activity is tapped. Custom methods like _buildActivityItem, _getActivityIcon, and _getActivityDescription are used for building individual components of the activity list.

### F-3.4 Activities shall be sorted by the type such as, like unlike, follow, comment.

**Description:**
The system will categorize and sort activities based on their type, such as likes, unlikes, follows, unfollows, comments and new story creation. This sorting feature ensures that users can easily navigate and view specific types of interactions.
