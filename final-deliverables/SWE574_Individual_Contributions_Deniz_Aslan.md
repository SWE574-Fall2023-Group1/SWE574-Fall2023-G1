### SWE 574 Software Development As A Team
### Individual Contributions - Group 1
### Deniz Baran ASLAN - 2021719183

### Summary:

As a member of the frontend team, I designed several pages of the web application, fixed frontend bugs, implemented a custom dark theme, contributed to my teammates' implementations and made adjustments to the default theme, fonts, and header.

I also served as the note taker to document and moderate general meetings, maintained our project's wiki and presented our progress at milestone meetings.

### Documentation:

As I was responsible for the wiki, I wrote many of the pages we have with contributions from teammates. Mainly: the homepage, conventions, communication plan, responsibility matrix, requirements, milestones and deliverables, user scenarios, meeting notes, and the team distributions. I was also the major contributor of the three milestone reports as per my role. In addition to authoring these documents, I proofread and corrected everyone's issue descriptions and pull requests as well.

### Most Significant Feature I Implemented:

The most significant feature I implemented in the project is the dark mode. As seen in issue [#299](https://github.com/SWE574-Fall2023-Group1/SWE574-Fall2023-G1/issues/299) and pull request [#314](https://github.com/SWE574-Fall2023-Group1/SWE574-Fall2023-G1/pull/314), I had to create a custom React theme, design the new theme, implement it for the relevant elements, and inspect each page thoroughly to fix the elements that did not integrate properly. This task was made more challenging due to our use of Material UI, which overrides CSS parameters for certain elements. We had to build a custom theme because the built-in dark theme of Material UI did not integrate well with our application. In order to make it work, I had to use in-line styling on many elements. See the screenshots below for the end result:
