* Create a pre-release version of your software that marks this version (check out how you create a release (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) in GitHub):
* Release Name: 0.1.0-alpha (pre-release option)
* Release Description: Brief description of requirements that are covered
* Tag name: customer-milestone-1
* Your release should include the android package file (.apk).
* All instructions for building and running the software should be provided, including thedocker build instructions and environment variables, if any. A fresh programmer that isfluent with various programming tools but not docker itself nor your project, should beable to do the deployment (for both web and mobile) by just following your steps.

### Milestone Review:
* [Milestones](https://github.com/SWE574-Fall2023-Group1/SWE574-Fall2023-G1/wiki/Milestones)

#### Current Status
The web application is currently deployed online with the following features listed as deliverables for milestone 1:
- [x] Signup
- [x] Login
- [x] Logout (Web only)
- [x] Feed - Homepage
- [x] Profile Page (Web only)
- [x] Memory Creation (Web only)
- [x] Memory Viewing (Web only)

It is possible to sign up, log in, modify one's profile page, share a new memory, read memories, search memories, like memories, follow other members and leave comments on memories.
The mobile application has also been developed and published as an APK file, with the planned features present for milestone 1.
It is possible to register and log in on the mobile application, and see memories on the frontpage. The remaining features from the web version will be implemented in mobile for milestone 2.

#### Requirements Addressed
The following requirements have been addressed in the current release. For the ones that are yet to be addressed, consult the full requirements list above.

#### Future Plans
For milestone 2, we plan to implement the new recommendation, timeline visualization, notification and activity features to the web application. The mobile application will also be worked upon to catch up with the current features of the web version. The frontend will be rehauled to look better, new unit tests will be implemented, and the backend will be optimized to run more efficiently.
    
#### Feedback & Reflections
We have gone through an iterative process to better shape our requirements, where we had to remove and rewrite several requirements as per the customer's demands, and add a few new ones as well. We have also received feedback on which tools we will be using, and especially how well the wiki and the issues should be handled. We are currently making sure to keep good records of our contributions and progress, paying attention to commit messages, meeting notes, issue labels and deadlines.


#### Tools & Platforms Used:

| **Tool** | **Purpose** |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Android Studio | Development suite for building Android application |
| Discord | Sharing resources and holding online meetings |
| Django | Python-based backend framework for web development |
| Docker | Virtualization for deployment across devices |
| Figma | Designing mockup and web frontend |
| Flutter | SDK for cross-platform development |
| GCP | Cloud service to deploy application online |
| Git | Version control system to track changes |
| GitHub | Online repository for code, packages and documentation |
| GitHub Desktop | Desktop application to sync local repo with GitHub |
| HackMD | Online platform to write markdown collaboratively |
| Kanban Board | Visual management system to track progress |
| Notion | Productivity and note-taking web application |
| Postman | Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs |
| PostgreSQL | Database for persistent storage |
| pre-commit | Framework for managing multi-language pre-commit hooks |
| Swagger | Suite of tools for API developers |
| VS Code | IDE for developing application |
| WhatsApp | Immediate communication among group members |

We have been using git and GitHub to their full extent, having established our conventions at the beginning of the project. We have seen that WhatsApp and Discord are effective tools for communication, and GitHub issues along with the Kanban board serve as useful tools for progress tracking. Our current setup for the web application (Django - Swagger - PostgreSQL) is working well, and we intend to keep using Flutter for mobile development. Our application is Dockerized and deployed on GCP which facilitates online and cross-platform development, and VS Code along with Android Studio serve as our development suite. This report was written online on HackMD, and we intend to do the same for future reports. We are currently satisfied with our tools and workflow, but changes may be made if the need arises in the future.
